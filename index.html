      <p><strong>Early life</strong> -
        Charles Taze Russell was born to Scotch-Irish parents,[6] immigrant Joseph Lytel Russell (1813–1897) and Ann Eliza Birney (1825–1861), on February 16, 1852 in Allegheny, Pennsylvania.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Youth - </strong>At age thirteen, Russell left the Presbyterian Church to join the Congregational Church. In his youth he was known to chalk Bible verses on fence boards and city sidewalks in an attempt to convert unbelievers; he particularly noted the punishment of hell awaiting the unfaithful.[9]
      </p>
      <p> <strong>Marriage</strong> -
        On March 13, 1879, Russell married Maria Frances Ackley 1850–1938) after a few months' acquaintance.[12] The couple separated in 1897. Russell blamed the marriage breakup on disagreements over Maria Russell's insistence on a greater editorial role in Zion's Watch Tower magazine
      </p>
      <p><strong>Ministry</strong> -
        About 1870, Russell and his father established a group with a number of acquaintances to undertake an analytical study of the Bible and the origins of Christian doctrine, creed, and tradition.<br>
        In 1881, Russell founded Zion's Watch Tower Tract Society, with William Henry Conley as president and Russell as secretary-treasurer; they intended to disseminate tracts, papers, doctrinal treatises and Bibles.
      </p>
      <p><strong>1916 - died</strong> October 31, (aged 64)
        Pampa, Texas, U.S.
